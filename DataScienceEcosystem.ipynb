    "- **NumPy**: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: A software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting, including model selection and evaluation tools.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow**: An open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.\n",
    "- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics."
